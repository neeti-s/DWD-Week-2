    <h1>Aavi</h1>
    <p>
    Aavi means “vapour” in Tamil. It is the word used for the steam from an idli cooker, the morning haze above a village lake, or the misty cloud of a person’s breath on a chilly night in the Nilgiris. <br><br>
    The word also signifies the vital spirit of a living thing: the sigh that leaves the body at the moment of death, to linger on as a ghost.
    Most ghosts in Indian stories can take on a physical form. They disguise themselves as real, solid people that can be touched and felt. They can pick things up, wield weapons, do chores, eat food. They are often colourful: in cartoons and picture books, they’re drawn with bright blue or green or orange skin. They usually have fangs. When they aren’t in corporeal form, they either become invisible or transform into thick purple smog. They tend to be raucous and loud and vicious and bloodthirsty, whether or not they had that sort of a personality when they were alive. <br><br>
    The Aavi is an anomaly. In many ways it resembles the ghosts of Western stories more closely than Indian ones. It is wispy, white, forlorn, and brooding. It retains a lot of its personality from life, recalling its friends and loved ones as well as its enemies and its unfulfilled desires. Aavis can have only limited interaction with objects in the material plane, and they have a tendency to disappear into thin air when threatened. <br><br>
    Not to say that they can’t be scary. An Aavi might stretch its spectral arm through a wall, slowly moving its fingers as though grasping for something, sending any witnesses screaming away in terror. Or on a still and moonless night, its transparent head might roll out from underneath a cot, give a few anguished sobs, and then vanish. <br><br>
    But they almost never eat anyone.<br><br>
    An Aavi that retains ties to the world of the living is typically a murder victim, or perhaps a lover driven to suicide. It can possess people, but it rarely causes illness or madness. Instead, the Aavi provides information to help others avenge its death. When it enters a living person, it causes them to start speaking in an unnatural voice; or else it makes the spirit-medium fall into a trance and set its secrets to paper in strange and unfamiliar handwriting. <br><br>
    Some of the similarity between the Aavi and the ghosts of Europe may be traced to the Tamil country’s ancient Christian community, or to the long centuries under colonial rule. But much of the influence is probably due to a more specific band of travellers: the Theosophists.
    In the late 19th century, a religious movement known as Spiritualism was ascendant in the Western world. Its adherents believed that the human soul was distinct from matter and that it remained active after death. Many of them rejected mainstream Christianity and set out eastwards in search of ancient secrets and esoteric knowledge. <br><br>
    Several prominent Spiritualists—including Annie Besant, Henry Steel Olcott, Charles Leadbeater, and Helena Blavatsky—made their way to Madras. In the 1880s, on a 260-acre campus on the south bank of the Adyar River, they established the International Headquarters of the Theosophical Society, an organization devoted to “investigating the unexplained laws of Nature”.<br><br>
    Their major preoccupation was making contact with ghosts. The members of the society, and Madame Blavatsky in particular, were famous for holding séances, during which spirit-mediums would channel energies from “the other side”. Some of the mediums would ooze ectoplasm, a viscous supernatural goo that supposedly flowed from the orifices during a visitation. Others would engage in a practice called automatic writing, letting paranormal forces move their pens across the page without their conscious effort.<br><br>
    Not all of the early Theosophists were pure in their motives. Blavatsky was accused of being a fraudster who used cheap magic tricks to fool people. Others confessed to darker crimes. Nevertheless, their “occult investigations” had an outsized impact on the South Indian imagination. 
    For example, Blavatsky had a theory, expounded in her 1888 book The Secret Doctrine, regarding an ancient sunken continent called Lemuria. In the ancient past, this continent was supposed to have occupied most of what is now the Indian Ocean, connecting Sri Lanka to Madagascar and Australia. Blavatsky proposed Lemuria as the land of what she called the “Third Root Race”—ancestral humans who had lived alongside the dinosaurs. Her idea was taken up by native writers of the Tamil renaissance, who gave the ancient landmass the name Kumarikandam (or Tamilagam). A popular pseudohistory emerged in which Kumarikandam was the birthplace of Tamil civilization. Some said it had been a land ruled by a succession of powerful women; others asserted that it had been the seat of the Pandian Dynasty for 10,000 years, before sea levels rose and the ocean claimed it. <br><br>
    By the 1950s, the scientific community had turned to embrace the theory of plate tectonics, which showed that Lemuria could never have existed. The southern landmasses of the world were indeed once connected—but that was some 150 million years ago, long before the evolution of humans. They have been drifting apart ever since. <br><br>
    Despite these revelations, the legend of the lost continent endures. Tamil politicians and orators still draw allusions to a mythical homeland sunk beneath the waves, and Kumarikandam remains a popular subject in Tamil poetry and speculative fiction.<br><br>
    Though Blavatsky died in 1891, the Theosophists’ efforts to contact the spirit world continued into the 20th century. Indeed, the Society remains active today, though it is less focused on generating ectoplasm than it once was.<br><br>
    In the meantime, the city of Madras, now Chennai, expanded and grew around it, developing into a major centre for publishing and filmmaking. Generations of writers grew up hearing stories about spirit mediums and astral bodies. It would seem that the Aavi of Tamil popular culture, of countless television serials and pulp horror novels, is modelled at least in part after the spirits that were channeled at the séances in Adyar. <br><br>
    Akin to the Aavi, but more powerful and malevolent, is the Pey, sometimes called Pey Aavi. These more volatile South Indian spirits probably represent an older stratum of belief. The word Achuthaavi or “unclean spirit” is also used, especially in Christian contexts, for a possessing demon which must be exorcised.
